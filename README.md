# UniversalExceptionInformation
<b>NOTICE</b>
I have some local repository projects that make this project obsolete once again and only Exceptions is required, along with implementation 
to replace Checked Exceptions.
<b>Description</b>
Library for making objects that decribe exception without type-checking and more information than regular java exceptions.
